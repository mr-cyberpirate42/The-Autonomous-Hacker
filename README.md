## 🚀 What is This?

Autonomous Hacker is not just another AutoML tool—it's a **self-evolving competition intelligence system** that:

- 🔍 **Automatically detects competition "vibe"** (meta-features and patterns)
- 🧠 **Learns from every competition** through continuous meta-learning
- ⚡ **Generates adaptive strategies** based on detected patterns
- 🎯 **Dominates leaderboards** with multi-agent coordination
- 🔄 **Evolves its approach** with each new competition

## 🎯 Key Features

### 🤖 Multi-Agent Architecture
```python
# Deploy specialized agents for each task
agents = {
    "vibe_detector": "Analyzes competition characteristics",
    "strategy_planner": "Generates optimal approaches", 
    "model_trainer": "Executes and optimizes models",
    "meta_learner": "Learns across competitions"
}
🔍 Intelligent Vibe Detection
Meta-feature extraction from datasets

Competition pattern recognition

Automatic strategy recommendation

Complexity assessment and adaptation

🧠 Continuous Meta-Learning
python
# The system learns from every competition
knowledge_base.update({
    "competition_pattern": "high_dimensional_classification",
    "winning_strategy": "lightgbm_heavy_regularization",
    "performance_boost": "+15% over baseline"
})
⚡ Adaptive Strategy Generation
Vibe-based model selection

Dynamic hyperparameter optimization

Intelligent feature engineering

Automated ensemble construction

🛠️ Quick Start
Installation
bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/autonomous-hacker.git
cd autonomous-hacker

# Install dependencies
pip install -r requirements.txt

# Install in development mode
pip install -e .
Basic Usage
python
from autonomous_hacker import VibeHackingOrchestrator
import pandas as pd

# Initialize the agent system
hacker = VibeHackingOrchestrator()

# Load your competition data
data = pd.read_csv('your_competition_data.csv')

# Run autonomous analysis and strategy generation
results = await hacker.dominate_competition(
    data=data,
    competition_name="your_competition",
    time_limit="6h"
)

# View the generated strategy
print(f"Detected Vibe: {results.vibe_type}")
print(f"Recommended Models: {results.recommended_models}")
print(f"Expected Performance: {results.expected_score}")
